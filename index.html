            	<p>I wanted a way to run the current test I was editing when I know the name of the method, but I&#8217;m too lazy to scroll up and see which class it&#8217;s defined in and then have to type that out as well. So I found a way for py.test to run any test in any class in a file by just giving it the name of that test or part of its name.</p>

	<p>Instead of typing:</p>

<pre>
$ py.test path/to/my/test/test_file.py::MySuperLongClassNameTest::test_my_thing
</pre>

	<p>I can just type:</p>

<pre>
$ py.test path/to/my/test/test_file.py -k test_my_thing
</pre>

	<p>Or even:</p>

<pre>
$ py.test path/to/my/test/test_file.py -k test_my
</pre>

	<p>Or even:</p>

<pre>
$ py.test path/to/my/test/test_file.py -k &#34;thing or stuff&#34;
</pre>

	<p>Woo py.test!</p>

	<p><span class="caps">FWIW</span>, <code>nosetests</code> can also do this with the <code>-m</code> option which supports regexp. But <span class="caps">AFAIK</span> it does not support the human-friendly <code>&#34; or &#34;</code> interface like in the last example above.</p>

	<p>A <em>very</em> simplified version (the original has all the different files being processed in different functions on different rules and it actually has error handling) of this function is this:</p>

	<p>As unit tests should be self-contained, they shouldn&#8217;t read any files on disk. So we need to mock them. I generally use Michael Foord&#8217;s <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/">mock</a>.</p>

	<p>In order to intercept calls to python&#8217;s <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#open">open()</a>, we need to mock the <code>builtins.open</code> function:</p>

<div class="Python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">TEST_PROXY</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;http://example.com:1111&#39;</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_proxy_url_in_sysproxy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">patch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;builtins.open&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                    <span class="n">return_value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">io</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">StringIO</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;http_proxy = &quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">TEST_PROXY</span><span class="p">)):</span>
         <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertEqual</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">TEST_PROXY</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">get_proxy</span><span class="p">())</span>
</pre></div>
</div>

	<p>We&#8217;re good so far. Now we add the next natural test: we didn&#8217;t find anything in sysconfig, but we find the right proxy <span class="caps">URL</span> on our second try in <code>CURL_PROXY</code>:</p>

<div class="Python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_proxy_url_not_in_sysproxy_but_in_yastproxy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>

        <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">patch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;builtins.open&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                        <span class="n">return_value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">io</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">StringIO</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39; --proxy &#39;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">TEST_PROXY</span><span class="p">)):</span>
            <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertEqual</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">TEST_PROXY</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">get_proxy</span><span class="p">())</span>
</pre></div>
</div>

	<p>Urgh. That&#8217;s starting to look a bit clunky. It&#8217;s also wrong since the inner <code>with statement</code> ends up overriding the outer one and all we get for our second <code>open()</code> call is a <i>closed</i> file object:</p>

<pre>ValueError: I/O operation on closed file.
</pre>

	<p>Not to worry though. <code>mock</code> <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/mock.html#mock.Mock.side_effect">side_effect</a> have got us covered!</p>

<div class="Python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_proxy_url_not_in_sysproxy_but_in_yastproxy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">patch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;builtins.open&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                    <span class="n">side_effect</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">io</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">StringIO</span><span class="p">(),</span>
                                 <span class="n">io</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">StringIO</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39; --proxy &#39;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">TEST_PROXY</span><span class="p">)]):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertEqual</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">TEST_PROXY</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">get_proxy</span><span class="p">())</span>
</pre></div>
</div>

	<p>The code looks cleaner now. A bit. And at least it works. But the list we pass in to <code>side_effect</code> makes another issue pop up. We now seem to be dependent on the order that the files are opened and read. That seems clunky. If we had to refactor our code to change the order that we read files in <code>get_proxy()</code> we would also had to change all our tests. Also it&#8217;s not quite obvious why we&#8217;re setting our return values as side effects.</p>

	<p>Ideally we&#8217;d have a way to assign each result to a filename and then not have to care about the order in which the files are open. In real life we would have two files with different contents anyway.</p>

	<p>So let&#8217;s implement that method. We, of course, want to make it a context manager.</p>

<div class="Python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nd">@contextmanager</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">mock_open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">contents</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">mock_file</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">io</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">StringIO</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">contents</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">patch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;builtins.open&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">mock_file</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">yield</span>
</pre></div>
</div>

	<p>So we only intercept the filename that we want to mock and let everything else pass through to <code>builtins.open()</code>. The <code>yield</code> is there because a contextmanager should be a generator function. Everything before the <code>yield</code> gets executed when entering the <code>with mock_open ...</code> statement, then the content of the <code>with</code> block is executed and then everything after the <code>yield</code> in our mock_open function (there&#8217;s nothing there in our case).</p>

<div class="Python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_proxy_url_not_in_sysproxy_but_in_yastproxy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">mock_open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">SYS_PROXY</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">mock_open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">CURL_PROXY</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39; --proxy &#39;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">TEST_PROXY</span><span class="p">):</span>
            <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertEqual</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">TEST_PROXY</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">get_proxy</span><span class="p">())</span>
</pre></div>
</div>

	<p>Looks good.</p>

<pre>RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison
</pre>

	<p>Oops. It seems that we got into infinite recursion because we&#8217;re calling the mocked <code>open()</code> from the mocking function. We have to make sure that once we&#8217;ve mocked a call to <code>open()</code>, there&#8217;s no way we&#8217;re going to go through that mock again. Thankfully, the mock library provides methods to turn mocking on and off without using the <code>with mock.patch</code> context manager. Take a look at <code>mock.patch</code>&#8217;s <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/patch.html#patch-methods-start-and-stop">start and stop methods</a>.</p>

</div>

	<p>So we had to replace the <code>with mock.patch</code> statement with manually <code>start()</code>-ing and <code>stop()</code>-ing the mocking functionality before and after the <code>yield</code>. That&#8217;s basically what the <code>with</code> statement was doing, we just needed the indentifier so we can use it in the <code>else</code> branch.</p>

	<p>In the <code>else</code> branch we turn off the mocking before calling <code>open()</code> (that&#8217;s what was causing us to go in the infinite loop). After we&#8217;ve called <code>open()</code>, we go back to mocking <code>open()</code>, in case there will be a future call that we actually do want to mock.</p>

	<p>Test code now looks the same as before:</p>

<div class="Python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_proxy_url_not_in_sysproxy_but_in_yastproxy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">mock_open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">SYS_PROXY</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">mock_open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">CURL_PROXY</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39; --proxy &#39;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">TEST_PROXY</span><span class="p">):</span>
            <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertEqual</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">TEST_PROXY</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">get_proxy</span><span class="p">())</span>
</pre></div>
</div>

	<p>But this time it works. So we could all go home now.</p>

	<p>But say we wanted to ensure that no files were opened inside the <code>with mock_open</code> block other than the ones we mocked. It seems like a pretty sensible thing to do. Unit tests should be completely self-contained so you want to ensure they won&#8217;t be opening any files on the system. This would also catch some bugs that might only later pop-up on your CI server&#8217;s test runs, because of a custom development machine configuration.</p>

	<p>The problem is pretty simple if you use only one <code>with mock_open</code> block, but once you start using more than one nested contest managers you have a problem. You need to have a way to communicate between the different context-managers. Ideally you&#8217;d have a way for each context-manager to say to the others (after it&#8217;s finished processing): <em>hey, I finished my work here, but some dude opened a file which I didn&#8217;t mock. Did you mock it?</em>.</p>

	<p>So how do we solve that? We&#8217;ll use <code>global</code> variables! No. Just kidding.</p>

	<p>We&#8217;ll use exceptions. Simply make the inner statement raise a custom <code>NotMocked</code> exception and let the enclosing context managers catch.If none of the enclosing context managers mock the file that was opened in the inner block, they just let the user deal with the exception.</p>

	<p>So the exception can be a normal <code>Exception</code> subclass, but we need an extra bit of information, the <code>filename</code> that wasn&#8217;t mocked. I&#8217;ll also hardcode an error message in there:</p>

<div class="Python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">NotMocked</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ne">Exception</span><span class="p">):</span>

	<p>So we&#8217;re recording all the files that were opened in the <code>open_files</code> list. Then after all the code inside the <code>with</code> block was executed, we go through the <code>open_files</code> list and raise a <code>NotMocked</code> exception for each of those file names. We also added a new <code>complain</code> parameter just in case someone would like to turn this functionality off (maybe they want to use file fixtures after all).</p>

	<p>The StringIO objects now also have a <code>name</code> attribute. It&#8217;s a bit tricky to see why this is needed since at first sight those objects never get into the open_files list. But when we have nested <code>with mock_open</code> blocks the file returned by the <code>open()</code> function in <code>mock_file</code> might actually have been mocked by an enclosing context manager and its type would then be <code>StringIO</code>.</p>

	<p>The <code>try: except:</code> block around <code>yield</code> is for the enclosing context managers. When they get a <code>NotMocked</code> exception by running the code inside them, they check if it&#8217;s the file they&#8217;re mocking, in which case they ignore it. (Basically telling the nested context manager: <em>I&#8217;ve got you covered.</em>). If the <code>NotMocked</code> exception was raised on a file that&#8217;s different than the one they&#8217;re mocking, they simply re-raise it for someone else to deal with (either an enclosing context-manager) or the user.</p>

	<p>If we now added another <code>open()</code> call in our initial <code>get_proxy()</code> function, or inside the with statement in the test case,</p>

</pre></div>
</div>

	<p>we&#8217;d get this error:</p>

<pre>NotMocked: The file /dev/null was opened, but not mocked.
</pre>

	<p>Cool. Now how about the opposite? I had to refactor a lot of these test cases and at some point I wasn&#8217;t sure that all those assertions made sense. Was I really hitting all the files I had mocked? Well we could just add another check in our <code>mock_open()</code> code to see if all the files that were mocked, were actually accessed
 by the test code:</p>

</div>

	<p>We now track mocked files as <code>open_files</code>, too. Then at the end, we simply check if the file that we were supposed to be mocking (passed in as the <code>filename</code> argument) was indeed opened.</p>

	<p>The gotcha here is that we need to raise this exception before <code>NotMocked</code>, otherwise we risk the code not ever getting to the file-not-opened check. I guess this is where the difference between using exceptions when something exceptional occured vs. when you want to communicate with the enclosing function becomes obvious.</p>

	<p>If we now added another <code>mock_open</code> that we weren&#8217;t using to the test code:</p>

<div class="Python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_proxy_url_not_in_sysproxy_but_in_yastproxy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>

</pre></div>
</div>

	<p>We&#8217;d get:</p>

<pre>AssertionError: The file /dev/null was not opened.
</pre>

	<p>EDIT: Eric Moyer found a bug (and suggested a fix) in this implementation. When the same file is opened multiple times, the <code>open_files</code> list will contain the filename multiple times, but it will only get <code>remove</code>-ed once. This can be easily solved by making the <code>open_files</code> list a set instead.</p>

	<p>So that&#8217;s about it, we now have a rock-solid <code>mock_open</code> function for mocking the builtin <code>open()</code>.</p>

	<p>Before we set it free, we need to add a nice docstring to it:</p>

        <div class="entry">
            	<p>I went to <a href="http://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a> this year. Thanks <a href="http://suse.com">SUSE</a> for sponsoring my trip! Here is a short review for the projects that I found interesting at this year&#8217;s <span class="caps">FOSDEM</span>.</p>

	<h4><span class="caps">SATURDAY</span></h4>

	<h4><a href="http://aeolusproject.org/">The Aeolus Project</a></h4>

	<h5>Francesco Vollero &#8211; Red Hat</h5>

	<p>This is a very interesting project if you can go past how <em>meta</em> it is.  It wants to be an abstraction over all the existing private and public cloud solutions. The aim of the project is to be able to create and control a virtual system throughout its life cycle. It can be converted from one VM image format to another and be deployed/moved from one cloud provider to another. Groups of images can be setup and controlled together. The way resources are managed and billed would also be cloud-independent.</p>

	<p>It relies heavily on the DeltaCloud project.</p>

	<h4>Open Clouds with <a href="http://deltacloud.apache.org/">DeltaCloud</a></h4>

	<h5>Michal Fojtik &#8211; Red Hat</h5>

	<p>DeltaCloud aims to be a RESTful <span class="caps">API</span> that is able to abstract all of the other public or private cloud APIs, allowing for the development of cloud-independent software.  The project says it wants to be truly independent (esp. from Red Hat). It was accepted as a top-level Apache project.</p>

	<h4><span class="caps">DMTF</span> <span class="caps">CIMI</span> and Apache DeltaCloud</h4>

	<h5>Marios Andreou &#8211; Red Hat</h5>

	<p>The <span class="caps">CIMI</span> <span class="caps">API</span> is a specification for interacting with various cloud-resources. A lot of very big companies are part of the <span class="caps">DMTF</span> Cloud Management Working Group: Red Hat, VMware Inc., Oracle, <span class="caps">IBM</span>, Microsoft Corporation, Huawei, Fujitsu, Dell. It is currently being implemented as part of the DeltaCloud <span class="caps">API</span>. The presenter also showed some implementation details: a lot of the code is shared between the DeltaCloud and the <span class="caps">CIMI</span> <span class="caps">API</span>.</p>

	<h4>Infrastructure as an opensource project</h4>

	<h5>Ryan Lane &#8211; Wikimedia Foundation</h5>

	<p>The talk went into some detail about the whole Wikimedia setup. It is built on top of open source projects and aims to be entirely free and available to anyone who wants to know more about it. The speaker presented some of the issues that the Wikimedia organization faced when they decided to give full root access to their machines to volunteers and how to allow for different levels of trust.</p>

	<h4>Orchestration for the cloud &#8211; <a href="https://juju.ubuntu.com/">Juju</a></h4>

	<h5>Dave Walker &#8211; Canonical</h5>

	<p>Juju is a system for building recipes of configurations and packages that can then be deployed on openstack/EC2 systems. The project aims to integrate with tools like chef and puppet to be able to manage deploying, connecting, configuring and running suites of applications in the cloud.</p>

	<h4>OpenStack developers meeting</h4>

	<p>This was a rather informal discussion. 4 major distros were present: Fedora, Ubuntu, <span class="caps">SUSE</span> and Debian, but also some other contributors. Upstream asked about the problems that distributions face, some minor one-time occurrences were discussed briefly. Stefano Maffulli, the openstack community manager was also present and there were some heated discussions about the way the project is governed. There are still a lot of things being discussed behind closed doors. Negotiations about the future of the project and fund-gathering is done with only a few big companies at a very high level. The community, on the other hand, was very vocal about wanting to rule itself with no enterprise interference.</p>

	<h4>Rethinking system and distro development</h4>

	<h5>Lars Wirzenius</h5>

	<p>Advanced the idea of maintaining groups of packages, all locked at a specific version. Having the maintainers always know which combination of versions a bug comes from would make the whole environment easier to replicate and the bug easier to reproduce. This would also, supposedly, reduce some of the complexities of dealing with dependencies.</p>

	<p>These groups of packages would be built directly from the upstream&#8217;s sources, following rules laid out in a git repository. The speaker also said he wants to get rid of binary packages completely.</p>

	<p>If this were to be implemented, distributions could write functional tests against whole systems (continuously built images), rather than individual binary packages and ensure that a full configuration works.</p>

	<p>Someone from the audience mentioned that a lot of the ideas in the talk are already implemented in NixOS(nixos.org) (which looks like a very interesting project in itself).</p>

	<h4><span class="caps">SUNDAY</span></h4>

	<h4>Continuos Integration/ Continuos Delivery</h4>

	<h5>Karanbir Singh &#8211; CentOS</h5>

	<p>The speaker discussed the system which CentOS uses for continuous integration. I liked their laissez-faire approach to which type of functional test language they should be using. They basically allow any type of language/environment to be used when running tests. The only requirement is that the test returns 0 on success and something else on failure. Anyone can write functional tests in any language they want (they just specify the packages as requirements for their test environment). People can choose to maintain different groups of packages along with the tests associated to them.</p>

	<h4>The Apache <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org">Cassandra</a> Storage Engine</h4>

	<h5>Sylvain Lebresne</h5>

	<p>A lot of interesting concepts about the optimizations that were made in the Cassandra project in order to speed up writes and make reads twice as fast (almost as fast as reads): different levels of caching, queuing writes, merge sorting the read cache with the physical data on reads etc.</p>

	<h4><a href="http://freedomboxfoundation.org/">Freedom, Out of the Box!</a></h4>

	<h5>Bdale Garbee</h5>

	<p>An interesting project about making a truly free easily available software as well as hardware system. Some interesting concepts are used in this project like <span class="caps">GPG</span> keys for authentication, but also for the trust required to provide a truly decentralized peer based network, free from DNSes.</p>

<hr/>

	<p>I&#8217;ve been to a few other talks that I can&#8217;t remember anything from either because of the bad quality of the presentation or because I didn&#8217;t have the prerequisite knowledge to understand what they were talking about. Next time I should also take notes.</p>

	<p>A lot of the talks were recorded and are available over here (with more coming): <a href="http://video.fosdem.org/2012/"><span class="caps">FOSDEM</span> 2012 videos</a>. The quality of the recordings (esp. in the main room) is sometimes even better than being there live. The voice is clearer and there is no ambient noise. Also, as it was really cold in most of the rooms &#8211; I had to keep my jacket and hat on.</p>
